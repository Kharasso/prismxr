{"m_guestComments":[],"m_curatorComment":{"comment":"The statue of a cherub is delicately crafted, capturing the innocence and playful charm of these celestial beings, with chubby cheeks and tiny, fluttering wings. It is positioned in a joyous pose, perhaps reaching for a star or chasing after a butterfly, enhancing the whimsical and enchanting nature of the sculpture. The detailed work on the cherub's curly hair and expressive face adds a touch of divine beauty to the piece.","playerName":"","playerID":0,"playerCommentID":0}}
